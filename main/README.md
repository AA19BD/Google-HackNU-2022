While 3D location data has been available for a while now, it still has quite a limited usage even in the most advanced maps solutions like Google Maps, Google Earth, food delivery apps, and so on. 3D location data has a huge potential in making everyday navigation easier for lots of use cases: shopping in a multi-storey shopping mall, helping firefighters locate the correct floor to extinguish a fire source in the skyscrapers, or for any other emergency responders to quickly get to where there is an incident.
